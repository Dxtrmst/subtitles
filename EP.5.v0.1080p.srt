1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,300
No, it's okay.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,300
Your wife will be mad.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,300
She won't be mad at me for this.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,300
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,300
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
I'll throw it away.

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Okay.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Here you are.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Here you are.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
Are you done?

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
I'm sorry. I'll be done soon.

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,300
Okay.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
She comes here often.

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,300
She likes you.

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,300
What's that?

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Here you are.

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Well...

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Thank you for the cake.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,300
It's okay.

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Call me when you're done.

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Well...

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Yes?

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,300
Do you have time after work?

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
What?

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
No, I don't.

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,300
Why?

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Well...

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,300
I have something to tell you.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,300
What is it?

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,300
I want to tell you about our contact.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Do you like me?

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
What?

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Our balance has never changed since we met.

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Is it interesting?

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Yes.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,300
You let me meet you without complaining.

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,300
You let me take a nap all day.

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Our balance has never changed since we met.

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Where did you look at the hourglass?

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,300
Where?

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Up, down, or in the middle.

50
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
What?

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Is it a quiz again?

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,300
There are three hours in the hourglass.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
What?

54
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Turn it over.

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,300
The lower hourglass is the past.

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,300
The middle hourglass is the present.

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
The lower hourglass is the future.

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Where did you look at?

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,300
In the middle.

60
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Nina?

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
I look at the same thing.

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:45,300
The lower hourglass is the past.

63
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,300
The middle hourglass is the present.

64
00:03:49,300 --> 00:04:07,300
The lower hourglass is the future.

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,300
Here you are.

66
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Thank you.

67
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,300
I'm sorry I can't meet you.

68
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
It's okay.

69
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,300
What's wrong with you?

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Nothing.

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,300
I just remembered.

72
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,300
How was the hot spring?

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
It was a hot spring bath.

74
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Was it big?

75
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,300
I saw a star.

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,300
A star.

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,300
I'll get it.

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Thank you.

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
What about you?

80
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
I'm fine.

81
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll clean up.

82
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,300
I knew it was no good.

83
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm here.

84
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm home.

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Welcome back.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300
I'm tired.

87
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm sorry I didn't reply to your message.

88
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
No.

89
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm sorry, too.

90
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,300
I was working hard all morning.

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,300
I'm not ignoring you.

93
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,300
I know you're taking care of your work.

94
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Let's eat.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,300
I was tired.

97
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,300
I see.

98
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I'll eat tomorrow.

99
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
It's okay.

101
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
I'll do it.

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Thank you.

103
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
I bought a souvenir.

104
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,300
It's pretty.

105
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Good morning.

107
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Good morning.

108
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
You're early.

109
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,300
I woke up earlier than usual.

110
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
You, too?

111
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Me, too.

112
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,300
It's not good to sleep during a meeting.

113
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,300
I agree.

114
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Is that for the morning meeting?

115
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Yes.

116
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
I'll help you with your luggage.

117
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
No, thank you.

118
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,300
I'll go.

119
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Thank you.

120
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Niina.

121
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Yes?

122
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Is this the data you're using today?

123
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Well...

124
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Yes, it's okay.

125
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Oh, I see.

126
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,300
This is for you.

127
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Oh, it's from the hotel.

128
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Artemis, the goddess of the moon, can shine near Orion.

129
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
I bought it for myself.

130
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Niina, here you are.

131
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Thank you.

132
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,300
It's a gift for you.

133
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,300
I was so happy.

134
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Thank you.

135
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Good morning.

136
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Good morning.

137
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:54,300
I'll bring the extension cord.

138
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:02,300
At that time...

139
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Why?

140
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I know the meaning of tears.

141
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:18,300
I don't want to lose her.

142
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I know.

143
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,300
I'll go with someone.

144
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,300
I was sold to a friend.

145
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Why don't you go with Ryusei's girlfriend?

146
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
I can't.

147
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Didn't you see Ryusei?

148
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
I saw him with Kami.

149
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
He came back from his parents' house.

150
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
He's married.

151
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
I didn't mean to show you the stars.

152
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,300
I was so excited.

153
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
I ran away from him.

154
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
What about her?

155
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,300
This is her.

156
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,300
I did it.

157
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Look.

158
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
It's a star.

159
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
It's going to be a star.

160
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:37,300
It's cruel.

161
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Why do men cheat on their wives?

162
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,300
They go back to their wives.

163
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Why?

164
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,300
I thought we would be together.

165
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,300
What?

166
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,300
My wife noticed.

167
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
But she said she would break up with me.

168
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
She's pregnant.

169
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,300
I can't continue this relationship.

170
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
You're late.

171
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Are you on a business trip?

172
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
You're early.

173
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I finished the puzzle.

174
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Sit down.

175
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Thank you.

176
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
I'll have a cup of coffee.

177
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
It's 600 yen.

178
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Two, please.

179
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
How about the chocolate ice cream?

180
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
I'll have a cup of coffee.

181
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,300
I gave you a bite.

182
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Thank you.

183
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,300
I'm happy to be at work.

184
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm happy.

185
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Thank you.

186
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Thank you.

187
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Is this your lunch?

188
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
No, I'm not hungry.

189
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
What do you recommend?

190
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,300
The most popular is octopus rice.

191
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
If you want to eat a lot, roast beef.

192
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
I also recommend spicy Gapao rice.

193
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,300
By the way, I and my senior are Gapao rice.

194
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm Rupeken.

195
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Why did you get up early today?

196
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
I got up early this morning.

197
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I was preparing for the meeting room.

198
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Did you do it alone?

199
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I did it alone.

200
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:45,300
I need someone's help.

201
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Here are two Gapao rice.

202
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Thank you.

203
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Let's eat here.

204
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll get a seat.

205
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Is this a good place?

206
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Yes.

207
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
I'm hungry.

208
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,300
I'm happy.

209
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Are you okay?

210
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Are you okay?

211
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Thank you.

213
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Makoto?

214
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Makoto?

215
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
What are you doing?

216
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
I was going to go to Makoto's company.

217
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Nina's...

218
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,300
She is a colleague of mine.

219
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm sorry I'm late.

220
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm Nina's wife.

221
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,300
My husband always takes care of me.

222
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm Kitahara.

223
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm Yoshino.

224
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,300
You are the editor-in-chief of Jinja, right?

225
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm a big fan of your magazine.

226
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Thank you.

227
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,300
I read your article last month.

228
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
It was great.

229
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Thank you.

230
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
What did you do today?

231
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Makoto, you forgot this.

232
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Did you buy a comment?

234
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
I have a meeting with the director of Yamada.

235
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I have to finish it in 30 minutes.

236
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I have to go.

237
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Thank you.

238
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm going.

239
00:15:44,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Let's go.

240
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Why are you so busy?

241
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
I have to go to a meeting.

242
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
I have to go to a meeting.

243
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
I have to go to a meeting.

244
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Are you okay?

245
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Thank you.

246
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,300
I think I have a cold.

247
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Senpai, you are dating Nina, right?

248
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:37,300
You two are so serious.

249
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Hana-chan, why?

250
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Because you and Nina are in love.

251
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:56,300
You will be found out someday.

252
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Please be careful.

253
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I told you before.

254
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,300
You have to be prepared for a love that you can't find.

255
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:18,300
You have to realize that you and Nina's wife will hurt others.

256
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:30,300
You have to decide what to do.

257
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:38,300
You should stop being upset.

258
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,300
You will be in trouble.

259
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,300
I will support you.

260
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,300
But you are worried about Nina.

261
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
I'm fine.

262
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm fine.

263
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
I lost to you.

264
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I lost to you.

265
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I will talk to the manager.

266
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Please come back when you can.

267
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Nina, it's time.

268
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I will go downstairs.

269
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Hana-chan is right.

270
00:18:41,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I'm not a beautiful woman.

271
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Do you want this?

272
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:17,300
I don't like this.

273
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Is there anyone you want to go with?

274
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:40,300
You don't understand people.

275
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:05,300
I don't understand people.

276
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I don't understand people.

277
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:26,300
I don't understand people.

278
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm Nina's wife.

279
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I'm always taking care of you.

280
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:52,300
I don't know what to do.

281
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
What's wrong?

282
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
I'm not feeling well.

283
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
I'm going to rest.

284
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
What about dinner?

285
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
I haven't made it.

286
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
I ate it.

287
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I will buy it if I want it.

288
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:31,300
I don't understand people.

289
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,300
I'm not sure if I can meet Nina.

290
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I ate it.

291
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
It was delicious.

292
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,300
I ate it.

293
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,300
It was delicious.

294
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Why did you come suddenly?

295
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I came to the exhibition.

296
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,300
You don't usually do that.

297
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Was it a nuisance?

298
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
No.

299
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
But if you could contact me.

300
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I was thinking of contacting you when I got to the company.

301
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,300
I don't have a lunch box.

302
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Makoto.

303
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
You have something.

304
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
You have something you're thinking about.

305
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:36,300
If you have something, say it.

306
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:56,300
I'll tell you.

307
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Why are you with me?

308
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
What?

309
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,300
It's not sudden.

310
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,300
I know what you're thinking about.

311
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,300
So I'm helping you.

312
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:25,300
But I can't see your feelings for me.

313
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm doing this because I have you.

314
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,300
I'm grateful.

315
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,300
I'm doing this for the exhibition.

316
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
No.

317
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Why do you refuse to have sex?

318
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,300
I said it before, but not now.

319
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
It's not the time.

320
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,300
When is the time?

321
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
One year later?

322
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Two years later?

323
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,300
After I become editor-in-chief?

324
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:10,300
I'll wait forever?

325
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:24,300
We can't even have a good time together.

326
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Makoto.

327
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Do you hate me?

328
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Don't you like me?

329
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:54,300
I don't know.

330
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:19,300
I've never seen your face.

331
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:30,300
I didn't think Makoto was so depressed.

332
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
I didn't know he was so worried.

333
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
I forgot to send the data.

335
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I'll send it to you.

336
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Don't worry.

337
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Think about the priority.

338
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,300
First, contact the designer and ask if he can wait until tomorrow.

339
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Yes.

340
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,300
In this case, you should deal with the task in front of you.

341
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Yes.

342
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Good luck.

343
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Thank you.

344
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Contact the editor.

345
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,300
I'll send the email to the editor.

346
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
I've always overcome it like this.

347
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,300
From what I can do in front of me.

348
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
The designer is fine.

349
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Yes.

350
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Yokoi.

351
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Yes.

352
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
I'll be participating in the meeting from this evening.

353
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
What?

354
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes.

355
00:26:48,300 --> 00:27:15,300
I'm sorry.

356
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,300
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,300
What do you mean by people who don't understand people's feelings?

358
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Please forget it.

360
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Tell me.

361
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,300
I may have been born a light woman.

362
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,300
At least I don't sleep with people who don't have any feelings.

363
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Welcome.

364
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Welcome.

365
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
One person.

366
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Please prepare the basic design.

367
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
Yes, I have set it.

368
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Thank you.

369
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Welcome.

370
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:58,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

371
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything.

372
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,300
It's not your fault.

373
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:18,300
I'm sorry.

374
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Thank you for the confetti yesterday.

375
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,300
I was happy.

376
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,300
No.

377
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,300
I can't eat it because it's a waste.

378
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:38,300
I'm sorry.

379
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:47,300
I finally talked to you.

380
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Well.

381
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Yes.

382
00:29:52,300 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm sorry.

384
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:24,300
I want to see Orion.

385
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Miss Yoshino.

386
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Yes.

387
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,300
I'm right next to Artemis.

388
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Yes.

389
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Whatever happens.

390
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Yes.

391
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:37,300
I wonder if the day will come when I can touch this cold hand.

392
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Thank you for your hard work.

393
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Yes.

394
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,300
I.

395
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:03,300
I've been hurting you.

396
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:21,300
I've been protecting myself.

397
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:43,300
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:54,300
Please raise your head.

399
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,300
I've said too much.

400
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:10,300
But I'm glad I got through.

401
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Yes.

402
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Let's end this story.

403
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:22,300
Thank you for your hard work.

404
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm sure I'm unknown.

405
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:45,300
I've been hurting you like this.

406
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:56,300
I really have to apologize.

407
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:06,300
It's okay.

408
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:17,300
I wonder if I'm going to hurt you like this.

409
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Oh, sister.

410
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,300
What?

411
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
Hello.

412
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,300
It's been a long time.

413
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
Yes.

414
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Yes.

415
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Oh, wait a minute.

416
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
My sister is coming to Tokyo.

417
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
So?

418
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Can you take care of the children?

419
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
What are you going to do?

420
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
I don't know.

421
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
I'm fine with taking care of the children.

422
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
You don't like it, do you?

423
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
I refuse.

424
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
About a day.

425
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Is that okay?

426
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Yes, I'll take care of it.

427
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,300
Yes.

428
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I'm sorry.

429
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm fine.

430
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:16,300
No, no, no.

431
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Welcome back.

432
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,300
What's wrong?

433
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I thought I'd eat with you.

434
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,300
But I'm not going to leave you.

435
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
I burned it.

436
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I think the fire is through.

437
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Hamburg is surprisingly difficult.

438
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
I always ate normally.

439
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Kaede.

440
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,300
You don't have to force it.

441
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,300
It seems that the laundry is over.

442
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Kaede will do his best.

443
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,300
What is it now?

444
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:08,300
I'm angry.

445
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Makoto.

446
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,300
You didn't even let me see you.

447
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
What is this?

448
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
This?

449
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
This is a pancake mix.

450
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
Suzuki, do you like pancakes?

451
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
I love it.

452
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
I want to do it.

453
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Do it.

454
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
I'm going to do it.

455
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Can I do it?

456
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Yes.

457
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,300
I lost.

458
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
No, no, no.

459
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
Don't do that.

460
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:49,300
No.

461
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Let's play a game.

462
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,300
I'll wash my hands.

463
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,300
No.

464
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:28,300
I'm going to wash my hands.

465
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:36,300
I'm going to wash my hands.

466
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Do you want to make a new page?

467
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Yes.

468
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
This is fine.

469
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
What should I do?

470
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Sorry.

471
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Sorry to keep you waiting.

472
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Mom.

473
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Did you two have a good time?

474
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Yes.

475
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Thank you for taking care of the children.

476
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,300
No problem.

477
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,300
It was fun.

478
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
I'm thirsty.

479
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
I'm thirsty, too.

480
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Don't be sad.

481
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
I'll buy you a drink.

482
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Let's go to the vending machine.

483
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,300
Thank you.

484
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Let's go.

485
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,300
I'm running.

486
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,300
You saved me today.

487
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Thank you.

488
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,300
You're having a hard time every day.

489
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm afraid I'll have a harder time.

490
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,300
I'm getting a divorce.

491
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Really?

492
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Yes.

493
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:38,300
I'm going to talk to the lawyer today.

494
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,300
You should take good care of Michi.

495
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,300
She's gotten a lot better since she started dating you.

496
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
She's gotten a lot better.

497
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,300
She's gotten a lot better.

498
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:06,300
But even if you're married, if you're too fat, it hurts.

499
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,300
I'm fine.

500
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Even if you think you know each other, you don't know each other.

501
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:35,300
If you want to be together, you have to think about it.

502
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
I'm tired.

503
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,300
I'm fine.

504
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
I'm a little tired.

505
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,300
A little?

506
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,300
You're mean.

507
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,300
But it was fun.

508
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:01,300
I'm not a good person.

509
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,300
I may be hurting Michi.

510
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,300
I don't want to hurt her.

511
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Why are you saying that?

512
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,300
I'm trying to be nice to her.

513
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
What do you mean?

514
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,300
I'm trying to be nice to her.

515
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:26,300
I'm thinking about it.

516
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:43,300
I'm thinking about it.

517
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:54,300
It's warm.

518
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,300
I'm going to go.

519
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:05,300
I'm going to go.

520
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm going to go.

521
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:25,300
Are you done?

522
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:45,300
I'm going to go.

523
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:15,300
I'm sorry.

524
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:35,300
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,300
The past, the present, the future.

526
00:42:41,300 --> 00:43:06,300
I'm sorry.

527
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

528
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,300
I found a good place.

529
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Can we go tonight?

530
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:24,300
I'm sorry.

531
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,300
I can't see you anymore.

532
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:34,300
I knew it.

533
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:44,300
Let's go back to being just colleagues.

534
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm sorry.

535
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,300
I'm sorry.

536
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
But I...

537
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:24,300
I'm sorry.

538
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Our relationship will never last.

539
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,300
It's like a clock.

540
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,300
It's a moment when it glitters.

541
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,300
In that moment,

542
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:47,300
we're just running away.

543
00:44:47,300 --> 00:45:01,300
I'm sure Nina and I can only see now.

544
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,300
The reason why it's hard to be with you now

545
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:17,300
is because you and I have a past and a future.

546
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:52,300
I'm sorry.

547
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,300
Can we talk again?

548
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,300
I'm always fine.

549
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,300
I want you to tell me the truth.

550
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,300
I betrayed you.
