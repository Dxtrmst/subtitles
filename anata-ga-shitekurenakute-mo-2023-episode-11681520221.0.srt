1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What blocks exactly do you need from Susie?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,680
I know.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:27,680
So

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
I don't know.

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
The cherry blossoms are in bloom.

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Well, it's spring.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
I don't think I'll be doing any chores.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Let's go see the cherry blossoms.

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Really?

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
You're so energetic.

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Well, I'm young.

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
You're cute.

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Do you want it?

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,680
I'm going to make it soon.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Okay.

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Let's go home.

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Let's go.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm going to make it soon.

19
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm going to make it soon.

20
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Yuki, don't lie down.

21
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Close the door.

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I can't do this.

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm so wet.

24
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
I can't do this.

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Come here.

26
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Wait a minute.

27
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Come here.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:49,680
I'm so wet.

29
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't wear pants until the cherry blossoms are in bloom.

30
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Really?

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
It's not in bloom yet.

32
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,680
You'll catch a cold.

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm so tired.

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm so tired.

35
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm so tired.

36
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm so tired.

37
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm so tired.

38
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
You'll catch a cold.

39
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
You'll catch a cold.

40
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm so tired.

41
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Don't you want to go home?

42
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm so tired.

43
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm so tired.

44
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm so tired.

45
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Don't smoke in the room.

46
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm so tired.

47
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm so tired.

48
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm so tired.

49
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm so tired.

50
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm so tired.

51
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm so tired.

52
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm so tired.

53
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm so tired.

54
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm so tired.

55
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm so tired.

56
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm so tired.

57
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm so tired.

58
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm so tired.

59
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:47,680
I'm so tired.

60
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm so tired.

61
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I'm so tired.

62
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm so tired.

63
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I'm so tired.

64
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:37,680
I'm so tired.

65
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm so tired.

66
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm so tired.

67
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm so tired.

68
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I'm so tired.

69
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:27,680
I'm so tired.

70
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm so tired.

71
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:47,680
I'm so tired.

72
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm so tired.

73
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm so tired.

74
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I'm so tired.

75
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm so tired.

76
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm so tired.

77
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm so tired.

78
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm so tired.

79
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:07,680
I'm so tired.

80
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm so tired.

81
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm so tired.

82
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm so tired.

83
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm so tired.

84
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm so tired.

85
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm so tired.

86
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm so tired.

87
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm so tired.

88
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:47,680
I'm so tired.

89
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Is this yours?

90
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Thank you.

91
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:17,680
I forgot something.

92
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm a little worried about tomorrow's presentation.

93
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Thank you for your hard work.

94
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Thank you for your hard work.

95
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
I chose a draft from the proposal of the AI.

96
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,680
I thought it would be helpful to use old drawings that haven't been digitized.

97
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,680
The drawings of the Yamanogawa resort are very old.

98
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,680
The AI may not need them.

99
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,680
If you say that, the AI will judge that I don't need them.

100
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
It won't be judged.

101
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Why? I don't have anything.

102
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Yoshino.

103
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Yes.

104
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Which do you think is a genius, Einstein or Mozart?

105
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,680
You're talking about the same thing.

106
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,680
No, it's a quiz.

107
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Both?

108
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Then, Einstein.

109
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:38,680
What Einstein discovered may have been achieved if he had not been him, but if he had given the data to the AI and made it learn.

110
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,680
But Mozart created music that only he could make.

111
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
So the answer is Mozart.

112
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Yes.

113
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
The answer is that Mozart can't listen to music.

114
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Yes.

115
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Whose words do you think it is?

116
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
I don't know.

117
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
It's Einstein.

118
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,680
He loved Mozart's music more than anything.

119
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Both are too different.

120
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Certainly, they are not the same.

121
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,680
We humans can create something from nothing.

122
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
But the AI can't.

123
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:34,680
I see.

124
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,680
I feel like I was encouraged.

125
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I wanted to say something good.

126
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Yoshino, do you have time?

127
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Not yet.

128
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Nina, were you trying to find it alone?

129
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Well, I guess.

130
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,680
He pretends to go home early to make everyone go home early.

131
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,680
What a caring person.

132
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Are you okay?

133
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm sorry.

134
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm sorry.

135
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I'm sorry.

136
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Please.

137
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Hello?

138
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Yes, I'm still at work.

139
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm still looking for the stickers for tomorrow's presentation.

140
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
It's okay.

141
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I think I'll be a little late.

142
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:51,680
This is it!

143
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Sorry.

144
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I found it.

145
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I'm glad.

146
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm sorry to worry you.

147
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Good luck.

148
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Today is different for me and for Yoh.

149
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Why did this happen?

150
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:57,680
I've heard it somewhere.

151
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:21,680
When you miss having sex with your husband, it's a lesson.

152
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm sorry.

153
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I don't want a child right now.

154
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I just don't want to.

155
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:56,680
I want to be with Yoh.

156
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I want to be with Yoh.

157
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:32,680
I want to be with Yoh.

158
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Thank you for the food.

159
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,680
You were on the way here.

160
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,680
The night breeze feels good.

161
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,680
It's good.

162
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Beer after a sweat is the best.

163
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm sorry.

164
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,680
I don't like AI.

165
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,680
It's a human privilege.

166
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:15,680
But there are food robots and a taste sensor.

167
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,680
But I can't make food that failed to be a robot.

168
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Failed food?

169
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Only humans can make eggs.

170
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:36,680
But humans can eat it.

171
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
You're right.

172
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Why am I fighting with AI?

173
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Is that a room?

174
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
No.

175
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
It fell down.

176
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,680
It's a mess.

177
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Is it okay to do it at this time?

178
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,680
You're the wife, right?

179
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm late for work.

180
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,680
You're the editor-in-chief of a magazine.

181
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,680
You're cool.

182
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,680
What kind of person is your husband?

183
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,680
He works at a cafe.

184
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
He's nice.

185
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Not at all.

186
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,680
He does what he likes.

187
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
He's not interested in anything else.

188
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Men are like that.

189
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,680
What are you talking about?

190
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,680
He's famous for his wife's feelings.

191
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,680
He makes lunch boxes for her.

192
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,680
I like cooking.

193
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
I'm sorry.

194
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:06,680
I like cooking, but I don't touch the kitchen knife.

195
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
I'm sorry.

196
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm embarrassed to talk about my wife in front of a beautiful couple like you.

197
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Don't say that.

198
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Don't make me talk about you.

199
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:29,680
I'm worried about you.

200
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm sure you have a wife.

201
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
I'm sure you don't have a wife.

202
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm sure you don't have a wife.

203
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
I have a wife.

204
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,680
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

205
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm a sexist.

206
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Tell me.

207
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:06,680
How can I be sexy?

208
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,680
You're laughing.

209
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm sorry.

210
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm sorry.

211
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm sorry.

212
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:26,680
I'm sorry.

213
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Are you hungry?

214
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm hungry.

215
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Let's go.

216
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Let's go to a good ramen restaurant.

217
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm home.

218
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,680
You're always late.

219
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I was working.

220
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm sorry.

221
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm sorry.

222
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:35,680
I'm sorry.

223
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
I don't know.

224
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I don't know.

225
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,680
I don't know.

226
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:57,680
I don't know.

227
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,680
What's wrong?

228
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I'm a bit of a commuter.

229
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,680
If I were you, I'd be happy to talk to you again.

230
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Um... I've been giving up a bit, but...

231
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I'm trying to face the fact.

232
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Next time, please listen to my problems.

233
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Um... so... you don't have to meet me.

234
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Is it a nuisance?

235
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Not at all.

236
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,680
That's good. I'm on your side.

237
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
What? Side?

238
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Why do I drink the same taste every day?

239
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Because you like it.

240
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,680
If you like your coffee, you have to like the taste and the smell.

241
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
You can't drink anything else.

242
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
That's true.

243
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
The way you pour coffee is perfect.

244
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Think about how to make the other customers sleep.

245
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,680
I wonder if I can finish it early.

246
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:34,680
This?

247
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Hello!

248
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,120
Do you wanna go for some coffee?

249
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,640
Just wonder train been sucking WILL

250
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,880
trl

251
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,480
He talks and looks funny

252
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
I like you.

253
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
I'm the one who likes you.

254
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I love you.

255
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Yes.

256
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,480
I wish I could fly.

257
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm tired of playing the same game over and over.

258
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Because you keep updating it.

259
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
This is the latest version.

260
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Go the opposite way from the editing.

261
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Then, the sound will be better.

262
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I'll try it.

263
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
I found a hole.

264
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
This way.

265
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
This way.

266
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Ryo-chan.

267
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,480
It's next Wednesday.

268
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Yes?

269
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
I'm early.

270
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
You can go home early.

271
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,480
I don't think it's a promise.

272
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
You promised me first.

273
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,480
I don't know what's wrong.

274
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I'm tired of playing the same game over and over again.

275
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:30,480
I'm trapped in a maze.

276
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Yoshino-san.

277
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Are you okay?

278
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Yes, I'm almost done.

279
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,480
How's your family?

280
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,480
It's the worst.

281
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Is that so?

282
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm trying my best.

283
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Today is the farming agreement.

284
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Yes.

285
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,480
The night breeze is nice tonight.

286
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Yes.

287
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:54,460
Shinkansen

288
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Shinkansen

289
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:16,480
neko wa ashimoto de odori watashi sore wo nagamete iru

290
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,480
matsu no yoru wa sude ni kuraku ao mado ni mieru hoshi no hikari chikaku

291
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
No one comes

292
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,480
No one knows

293
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,480
I dance alone

294
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I can't dance well

295
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,480
That nostalgic song

296
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm a dream dress

297
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You're a limitless smile

298
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Feet in front, knees behind, arms open

299
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Like the wind, like the water, we sing

300
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Forgetting time

301
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Forgetting time

302
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,480
I'm a limitless smile

303
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
I'm home

304
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Welcome back

305
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
What's this?

306
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
The most expensive one

307
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
It's still in the fridge

308
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,480
I'm home

309
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Welcome back

310
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm home

311
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I'm so happy

312
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Stop it

313
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Do you want another one?

314
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Let's make a snack

315
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
I'm home

316
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:15,480
We tend to forget how happy it is not to be unhappy

317
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
I'm home

318
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Hello, I'm home

319
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
How are you?

320
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm doing well

321
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm glad I made it on time for your birthday

322
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Did you like my pajamas?

323
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
I'm home

324
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I want to sleep with my grandchild

325
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Tell your useless son

326
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I didn't mean to make you do it

327
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
I wish you'd pick up the phone

328
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm fine

329
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
You're always coming to me

330
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,480
You don't have to listen to your mother

331
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
You're not going to do it?

332
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm not saying that

333
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,480
I'm home

334
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
It's broken

335
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
You're a fool

336
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,480
It's been broken for 5 years

337
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm home

338
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I'm home

339
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:29,480
I wonder if you've changed

340
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
I wonder if you've changed

341
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm home

342
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I'm home

343
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:41,480
I'm home

344
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm home

345
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
I'm sorry

346
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
I'm late

347
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,480
I see

348
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I guess it can't be helped

349
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Do you want a beer?

350
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Or coffee?

351
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
I can't sleep

352
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,480
I'm relieved for a moment

353
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,480
I understand

354
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm home

355
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
I'm home

356
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm sorry

357
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
I'm relieved

358
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
But I'm not home

359
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,480
I see

360
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
I'm home

361
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,480
I see

362
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
I see

363
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Here you are

364
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
What?

365
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Open it

366
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
What?

367
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
What?

368
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,480
I found the same one

369
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,480
I bought what I wanted online

370
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,480
You should have sent me a message before buying it

371
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I'm sorry

372
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,480
I'm home

373
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Me too

374
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm changed

375
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Thank you

376
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,480
I don't like the key case

377
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,480
I said thank you naturally

378
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,480
even if it was a lie

379
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I need to change

380
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,480
I need to change

381
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,480
I've been fighting with my boyfriend

382
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,480
I'm sorry

383
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I want to know your true feelings

384
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
Can we talk?

385
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
I'm sorry

386
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
It's late

387
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
I have to go

388
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Yo-chan

389
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
It's okay

390
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Please

391
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,480
I'll tell you

392
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,480
I don't want to be told

393
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I want to change

394
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,480
You said you wanted a baby

395
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm sorry

396
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Wait

397
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
I'm upset

398
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Upset?

399
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,480
I've never said that

400
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,480
You just didn't do it

401
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Do you remember the last time we had sex?

402
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
It's been 2 years

403
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,480
It's been 2 years

404
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Did you want to do it that much?

405
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Michi

406
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Michi

407
00:43:42,480 --> 00:44:07,480
I'm sorry

408
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
I'm sorry

409
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm sorry

410
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm sorry

411
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Yoshino

412
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
How was it today?

413
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480
What?

414
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,480
I'm sorry

415
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,480
I'm sorry

416
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I'm sorry

417
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Really?

418
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,480
I threw a cushion at my husband

419
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
What?

420
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,480
We'll continue our fight tonight

421
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,480
He's good at running away

422
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,480
I don't know what will happen

423
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Don't push yourself too hard

424
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,480
I'm trying to push myself a little

425
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,480
I'm trying to push myself a little

426
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
It's fixed

427
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,480
Thank you

428
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,480
That's good

429
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Please sit down

430
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,480
Can I sit here?

431
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,480
Can I sit here?

432
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:24,480
Yes

433
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,480
I'm sorry

434
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,480
Sit down

435
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,480
I'll make you some coffee

436
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,480
Thank you

437
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,480
Welcome back

438
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Thank you

439
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,480
Do you want to eat now?

440
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm starving

441
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Do you need help?

442
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
No

443
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,480
I'm starving

444
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,480
Yes

445
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,480
Do you want to connect the remote?

446
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,480
I'll be back soon

447
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Did you get my data?

448
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Can you send it to me?

449
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,480
Can you send it to me?

450
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,480
In 30 minutes?

451
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,480
What's the specific time?

452
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I see

453
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,480
I'll prepare the data

454
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,480
If you want to make the main data, make it full size

455
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,480
If you can't, you can cut the material

456
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,480
Yes

457
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,480
I'll send it to you

458
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm sorry

459
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,480
It's my fault

460
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,480
Did you tell Michi?

461
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,480
Yes

462
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,480
I told her that I'll be late tonight

463
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
I told her that I'll be late tonight

464
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
I told her that I'll be late tonight

465
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,480
I'm afraid that I can't calm down

466
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,480
I heard that you can fight sometimes

467
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
About what?

468
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,480
I thought that I should live as I used to

469
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,480
I'm not married yet

470
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm not married yet

471
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,480
But we're not only married

472
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,480
We work and live together

473
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,480
We're good friends

474
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,480
I think we're good as a couple

475
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,480
Yo-chan

476
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,480
I don't want to be just a lover

477
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,480
I want to feel that you love me

478
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,480
Isn't that important for a couple?

479
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
I love you, so I'm not married

480
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,480
Isn't it normal to want to be loved?

481
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Why are you so calm?

482
00:49:50,480 --> 00:50:00,480
I'm not calm

483
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,480
I understand

484
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:12,480
I'll try

485
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:22,480
I'll try

486
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,480
I'm...

487
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm an ED

488
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:44,480
I'm an ED

489
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,480
I see

490
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,480
I'm sorry

491
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,480
Yo-chan is cheating

492
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,480
She lied to me

493
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,480
She ran away

494
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,480
I'm going to the party

495
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
Aren't you going to go?

496
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,480
I'll take a picture

497
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,480
I'm waiting for you

498
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,480
But I feel better

499
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,480
I want to feel better

500
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Everyone, please

501
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Kanaka, too

502
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
Thank you

503
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,480
I drank too much

504
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,480
I'm fine

505
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,480
I'll drink again

506
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Thank you

507
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,480
Are you okay?

508
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,480
I feel better

509
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,480
I see

510
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Can I go?

511
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,480
I'll go

512
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,480
Thank you

513
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,480
Let's go

514
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,480
I'm fine

515
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,480
I'm sorry

516
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,480
Are you sure you feel better?

517
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,480
What?

518
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,480
Do you really think so?

519
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,480
I think so

520
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,480
I feel like I've solved a difficult quiz

521
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,480
I don't have to do anything

522
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,480
I'm stupid when I'm serious

523
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,480
Why do you say that?

524
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,480
I didn't think so

525
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,480
Stop it

526
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Is my story interesting?

527
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:38,480
I finally realized that I don't have to think about it

528
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,480
Yoshino

529
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,480
I'm sorry

530
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,480
I feel like I'm drunk

531
00:53:45,480 --> 00:54:02,480
You're not drunk, are you?

532
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,480
I'm not satisfied anymore

533
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,480
I'm sure it will end as a woman

534
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,480
Wait

535
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,480
I'm not alone

536
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,480
I'm also a sexist

537
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,480
I'm being rejected

538
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,480
I feel like I'm being killed

539
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:45,480
I'm drunk

540
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,480
I pulled them

541
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,480
I don't know why

542
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,480
I feel like they came out

543
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,480
I don't know why

544
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,480
but I feel like I did

545
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,860
I see everyone's doing their best, what to watch or not to watch?

546
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,120
You will see.

547
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,360
Mym, we're talking about Tamaki.

548
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,060
All the factura are watching me.

549
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,160
Tamaki is watching lunch!

550
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:28,880
I don't know what they are.

551
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,880
I remember us both

552
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,880
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

553
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
We'll hug each other tight

554
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,880
The night and the night sky

555
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,880
The End

556
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,880
Her tears

557
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,880
seemed like tears that had been in me all along

558
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,880
I was avoided by Nino

559
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,880
I was avoided

560
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:17,880
Thanks for watching!

561
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,540
This video clip was created at the end of the free part of  cái FOD.
