1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
I...)

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,860
Honestly.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:20,560
I dunno...

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,140
Fix me.

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,000
The secret I turn my back on,

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,700
You wanted to get Yoshiho, but she said no.

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,080
Oh...

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
I'm watching the dog.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
I'm watching the dog.

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
It's okay.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,080
But I like spending time with Mitch.

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Oh, again!

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Oh, this is still a hundred yen.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Once you take it off, it's not worth it.

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,080
I feel like I'm connected, whether I'm naked or not having sex.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I'm going to get burned.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
I can't do my best today.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
You don't have to do it now.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Okay, if that's what you want.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
That's enough. Do you understand?

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm not playing!

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,080
It's not the time yet.

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Hello, have you done it?

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Yes.

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Can you send me an email? I'll check it out.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,080
When did sex become tiring?

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
You should look a little more back.

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
It's work tomorrow, isn't it?

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Sleep, sleep.

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Sex for me now is...

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Are you okay?

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
...just a process of getting tired.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
You don't have to get up.

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Didn't you hear me?

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Above all, if I have a child now...

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
When you get back, please prepare the credit and pay.

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Thank you for your hard work.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Everything I've built up will be gone.

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:39,080
I might break my dream.

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,080
It's not like lovers will always be together.

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Even if it's a couple, people are people.

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
After all, it's someone else.

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Even if it's my husband who loves me.

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Even if it's my wife who loves me.

45
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Is sex that important?

46
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,080
If you pour too much water, it'll rot.

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,080
That's not true.

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm going.

50
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Is there anything you want to eat tonight?

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Anything is fine.

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,080
I'll make what you like.

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
It's getting late, so eat first.

54
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Goodbye.

55
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,080
But why all of a sudden?

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,080
And at that time...

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
I couldn't do it until the end.

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
No, no, no.

59
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
What are you thinking?

60
00:05:50,080 --> 00:06:19,080
I've moved on.

61
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Is there anything new in the house?

62
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:33,080
I put it in the shared folder.

63
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Thank you for your hard work.

64
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Thank you for your hard work.

65
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm sorry about yesterday.

66
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,080
The phone...

67
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
No, it's not a big deal.

68
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,080
I was wondering if I could have ramen.

70
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
But yesterday...

71
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Nina, the meeting will begin.

72
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll be right there.

73
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Welcome.

75
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Welcome.

76
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
There's a lot in there.

77
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I'll continue.

78
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
It's a good reputation.

79
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
It's delicious.

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
It's you.

81
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,080
It's you.

82
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Something's changed.

83
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
The taste?

84
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:42,080
It's you.

85
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,080
It's time to give me a present.

86
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I'm not the type to give unexpected presents when I don't expect them.

87
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I wonder why.

88
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I want a return.

89
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,080
When I want to back up.

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,080
So, did you have something you wanted to back up?

91
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
I don't know.

92
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
I just went around.

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Don't take it.

94
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Only men know what's really on their mind.

95
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I'll ask.

96
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Do you have a boyfriend?

97
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Of course.

98
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
One or two.

99
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,080
But friendship between men and women doesn't work.

100
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm sure it will.

101
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I'll take my time.

102
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,080
You're still young.

103
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
You don't like him as a man.

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
You don't like him as a person.

105
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
That's love.

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
It's the seed of love.

107
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,080
If it sprouts from the seed, it will even break through concrete.

108
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,080
I wonder if Senpai is okay.

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
What?

110
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,080
I wonder if he has the strength to swallow unnecessary eyes.

111
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
To grow the eyes you really want to cherish.

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,080
You always say such a bad thing.

113
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I wonder if you have that strength.

114
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Excuse me.

115
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Can I have a witness?

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Yes.

117
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm Tanemaki.

119
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm here to get rid of bad eyes.

120
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Yes.

121
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,080
What do you do when a man gives you a present?

122
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
What's wrong?

123
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,080
I want to know what a man really wants.

124
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,080
It's because it's important.

125
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Like a thank you.

126
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
I see.

127
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
What's wrong?

128
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,080
I was consulted by Yoshino Senpai.

129
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
I see.

130
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,080
In short, I was told to curse.

131
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Maybe.

132
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Thank you.

133
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Nina.

134
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Good morning.

135
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Welcome back.

136
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm a farmer.

137
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Good.

138
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm going to sell one house.

139
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
That's hard.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Good morning.

141
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm glad you got a present.

142
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
I heard from Kitahara.

143
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Your husband gave you a present and you were cursed.

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
I was cursed?

145
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,080
I was cursed.

146
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,080
But I got a bouquet.

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
A bouquet?

148
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
It's strange.

149
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,080
It's not an anniversary.

150
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,080
It's an expression of love.

151
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:24,080
It's to make your loved one happy.

152
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,080
I'll accept your words.

153
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,080
And...

154
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:40,080
As a lesson partner, I'll tell you.

155
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Ah...

156
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Ah?

157
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Ah.

158
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Yes.

159
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I see.

160
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,080
I think I've made a little progress.

161
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
A big progress.

162
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Congratulations.

163
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Well...

164
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Is it strange?

165
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
No.

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Thank you.

167
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,080
When I got the bouquet, I was happy.

168
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:16,080
I thought I could convey my feelings a little.

169
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
That's good.

170
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,080
I was rewarded for my hard work.

171
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
I talked a lot.

173
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
No problem.

174
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Nina, too.

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Your wife was happy with the bouquet, right?

176
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Yes.

177
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Very.

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
That's good.

179
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
That's good.

180
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm here.

181
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Bye.

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Can't you go?

183
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
What?

184
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
No.

185
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
What?

186
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
I'll go to the store.

187
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Ah.

188
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Please.

189
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,080
You should go straight.

190
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Don't look sideways.

191
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,080
That's better.

192
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I'll go.

193
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I'll go.

194
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll go.

195
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
I'm in charge of coordination.

198
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
I can't sell it.

199
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I can't help it.

200
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
It's hard to sell.

201
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
It's all my fault.

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm in charge of this.

204
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,080
But you think you're the only one who's working hard.

205
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,080
No one will follow you.

206
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm sorry.

208
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:49,080
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:49,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Perfect.

212
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
It looks delicious.

213
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Right?

214
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:26,080
I'll eat it.

215
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Is it delicious?

216
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Yes.

217
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,080
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

218
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
I'm a little out.

219
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Don't worry about it.

220
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
It's the same when you eat it.

221
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,080
No.

222
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
I'm going to take a bath.

223
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Eat slowly.

224
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Thank you for the meal.

225
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I'll take a bath.

226
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
I'm going to take a bath.

227
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I'm going to take a bath.

228
00:19:48,080 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:23,080
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm sorry.

233
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm sorry.

234
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm sorry.

235
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:56,080
I'm sorry.

237
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
I'm sorry.

238
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm sorry.

239
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:20,080
I'm sorry.

241
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm sorry.

242
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:50,080
I'm sorry.

243
00:23:50,080 --> 00:24:06,080
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
You did what your grandmother said.

245
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:18,080
There are times when you want to be alone.

246
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,080
I'm going home.

247
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,080
I'll go with you.

248
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,080
I took a bath.

249
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Are you okay?

250
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Actually, it didn't go well.

251
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Wedding anniversary.

252
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I had a job that day.

253
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
I couldn't make it to dinner.

254
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm alone in the store.

255
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm embarrassed to have a bouquet.

256
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I couldn't give it to you.

257
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I see.

258
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,080
After that, I told my wife how I felt.

259
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:42,080
But it's like I'm blaming my wife.

260
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Why doesn't it work?

261
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Even if you try so hard.

262
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,080
It won't change forever.

263
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,080
I'm going to be stubborn.

264
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Because of that.

265
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I was clinging.

266
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,080
If you stack your body.

267
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,080
There's love in there.

268
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,080
But I realized it wasn't there.

269
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,080
It's the same.

270
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Yoshino-san is moving forward.

271
00:26:42,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I'm the same.

272
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,080
I thought I'd be satisfied with just sex.

273
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,080
But at that time.

274
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I don't think my husband feels that way.

275
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I knew it.

276
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:49,080
I just pretended not to notice.

277
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,080
It's like a fool.

278
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:03,080
You don't have to laugh.

279
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:14,080
You don't have to be patient in front of me.

280
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:22,080
It's okay.

281
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:34,080
I told Yoshino-san every day that I was encouraged.

282
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,080
It's not true.

283
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I am.

284
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:57,080
I am.

285
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Excuse me.

286
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Yes.

287
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I have a place to go.

288
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Where?

289
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,080
In the sea.

290
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,080
What?

291
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Wow!

292
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
It's a picture!

293
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
No, it's not.

294
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
It's you!

295
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I've never seen you before.

296
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
You're like a child.

297
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
I'm sorry.

298
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,080
I'm glad you're so honest.

299
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm glad, too.

300
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,080
There are many kinds of penguins here.

301
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Cute!

302
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
It's cute!

303
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Cute!

304
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Did you know?

305
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,080
There was a penguin the same height as me in ancient penguins.

306
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,080
That's not cute.

307
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
It's cute.

308
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,080
It's too serious.

309
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm sorry.

310
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Are you okay?

311
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm not okay.

312
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Are you okay?

313
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Wait a minute.

314
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Sit down.

315
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Did you get stung?

316
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,080
No, I'm fine.

317
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,080
It's too deep.

318
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I was worried.

319
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:48,080
I'm sorry.

320
00:30:48,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Thank you.

321
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Do fish cry?

322
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,080
They all look happy.

323
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Maybe one fish is crying.

324
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,080
I don't know if it's in the water.

325
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,080
I don't know if it's in the water.

326
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,080
It's okay.

327
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:57,080
I wonder if Nina is crying all the time.

328
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm sorry to bother you.

329
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,080
I'll be around here.

330
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Be careful.

331
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Thank you.

332
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,080
I was happy.

333
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,080
When I saw Yoshino at the promenade.

334
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,080
No.

335
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:55,080
I'm sorry.

336
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm sorry.

337
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Nostalgic.

338
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:41,080
Kind kiss.

339
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:56,080
I was with you.

340
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Kissing each other.

341
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:12,080
It's wrong.

342
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:59,080
I'm sorry.

343
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,080
I think the first kiss is the turning point.

344
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Let's finish it once.

345
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,080
I'm sorry.

346
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Welcome back.

347
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm sorry.

348
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,080
I'll go to bed.

349
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:36,080
I want you to have dinner with me tomorrow night.

350
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
I don't have to.

351
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
I don't have to.

352
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,080
I'll go out with my friends.

353
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,080
I'm fine.

354
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,080
I see.

355
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
What's for dinner?

356
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I'm sorry.

357
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
I only have what I left yesterday.

358
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
That's enough.

359
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
It's okay.

360
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,080
I'll warm it up myself.

361
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
I understand.

362
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I'll go to bed first.

363
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Good night.

364
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Good night.

365
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,080
It's rotten if you pour too much water.

366
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:59,080
That's not true.

367
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:27,080
I'm sick of myself.

368
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:47,080
I'm sorry.

369
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Are you pooping?

370
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I'm not.

371
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:59,080
I knew it.

372
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm not.

373
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
You're reading a manga while you're pooping.

374
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Are you constipated?

375
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
What?

376
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Your phone is going to fall.

377
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm sorry.

378
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Are you okay?

379
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,080
I'm not.

380
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
I'm not.

381
00:39:37,080 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm not.

382
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm sorry.

383
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:32,080
I made a mistake.

384
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,080
I'm not.

385
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
I'll go on your behalf.

386
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
You're my boss.

387
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm fine.

388
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,080
I can contact you.

389
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,080
You have a fever.

390
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm going to bed.

391
00:40:51,080 --> 00:41:20,080
I'm sorry.

392
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I'm fine.

393
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Do you have a prescription?

394
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
I'm going to bed.

395
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,080
You go to work.

396
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
I'll buy you something to eat.

397
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
No, thank you.

398
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I can drink water.

399
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:52,080
I see.

400
00:41:52,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Why are you being so nice to me?

401
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
I'm fine.

402
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm fine.

403
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Don't be nice to me.

404
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Thank you.

405
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,080
I'm fine.

406
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Call me if you need anything.

407
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Thank you.

408
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Let's go to Mitsumori-ka.

409
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:45,080
Yes.

410
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
I'll get a taxi.

411
00:42:47,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Sorry.

412
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:14,080
I'm sorry.

413
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,080
I'll be back.

414
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
I'm home.

415
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Good morning.

416
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,080
I just got here and just got home.

417
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,080
I wanted to go home because I had a cold.

418
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,080
So I was called.

419
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I didn't know he was a cold-blooded person.

420
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:31,080
I'm home.

421
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,080
I'm home.

422
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm home.

423
00:44:39,080 --> 00:45:02,080
I'm home.

424
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:12,080
I'm home.

425
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:52,080
I'm home.

426
00:45:52,080 --> 00:46:20,080
I'm home.
