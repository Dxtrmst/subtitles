1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I want to see Orion.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's a planetarium, but I found a really good place.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go back to being just colleagues.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't want to be alone.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to be with you.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's go back to being just colleagues.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I...

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I ran away from Nina.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I didn't think about the problem with my husband.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can forget him in a moment.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But I...

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wait, wait, wait.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Welcome back.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What happened?

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just finished.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's okay. I'll do it.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's okay.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's okay.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's delicious.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's eat.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not sure.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How is it? Is it good?

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, it's good.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's good.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's good.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You like it, right?

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's good.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I want a peaceful life.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to go on an adventure.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll try to do it.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm thinking about it.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm home.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Welcome back.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Dumplings?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I should have stopped.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I made too much.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not over yet.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't help it.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You-chan?

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's faster if we do it together.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you wash your hands?

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's okay if I burn my hands.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's okay.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's that?

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's this?

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't help it.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's the problem?

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to turn off the light.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm going to turn off the light.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't rush now.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Believe in what I say.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's okay.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We are a couple who swore to be together forever.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to turn off the light.

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Did you break up?

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm not prepared for that.

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can I have a fried chicken?

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll tell you if you want me to say something.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're right to break up.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It was hard to break up.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is that really okay?

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I thought you wanted me to say something.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll have a croquette instead.

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't want a child.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just wanted to make it a little longer.

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you hate me?

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know.

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's so hard to be rejected by your husband.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not reflected in the eyes of my husband.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to have a meeting with the press.

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going to talk to the head of the department.

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you.

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm going to talk to the head of the department.

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Mr. Niino.

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Do you want to use it next?

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, I'll help you.

86
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Did you have a meeting with the sales department today?

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It was decided suddenly.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I see.

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I thought there was something else to do in the conference room.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I forgot to get an employee from the head of the department.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll ask you later.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're back to your colleagues, right?

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll take this with me.

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't talk to you again.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've decided.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm going to talk to my husband.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going to talk to my husband.

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I want someone to tell me.

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't forget it.

106
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you want to eat tonight?

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't mind.

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The night is coming.

110
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Which do you want?

111
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not sure.

112
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're a game.

113
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not good at sheep.

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What?

115
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's rare.

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'd like a blend, please.

117
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I can get into the store right away.

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll contact my mother.

123
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You can show her.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Good evening.

126
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, Miki!

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I've been waiting for you.

128
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What's up?

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I thought we could go home together.

130
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I didn't have a reply, so I came.

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I just noticed.

132
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, it's your first time?

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

134
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mishima, she's my daughter.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hello, I'm Michi.

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My husband always takes care of me.

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hello.

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Did something happen?

139
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No.

140
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is the store already closed?

141
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

142
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tonight, we're going to...

143
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, I see.

144
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh!

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How about you, Michi?

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're going to welcome Mishima.

147
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, no, no.

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm going home.

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's have a long drink.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Welcome!

151
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Mishima!

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Cheers!

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Cheers!

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Cheers!

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I remember!

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You took me to eat yakiniku before.

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You and your wife.

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We went to eat yakiniku.

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, that?

162
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
When we went to order the wedding speech.

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How long ago was that?

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Five years.

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's been five years since you got married.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How about you, Mishima?

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm not married yet.

169
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Good women don't get married.

170
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, you mean good women don't get married?

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, I mean...

172
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Help me.

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hey!

174
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nice!

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry!

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry!

177
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's okay.

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not okay.

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm the one who's crying.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think I'm going to lose.

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Look at this.

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's kuppa and cold noodles.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's finish this.

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

186
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you.

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How about you, Kona?

188
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm okay.

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Eat whatever you want.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Then, I'll listen to you.

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's order one each.

192
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's share.

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm not sharing.

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I heard from my sister.

195
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you eat for the end of a barbeque?

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What's that?

197
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Excuse me.

198
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm back.

199
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's a psychological test.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can tell what you're cheating on.

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The one who cheats the most gets...

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What did I say?

203
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

204
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Have you eaten?

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Not yet.

206
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What about you?

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Me neither.

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll take this.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
See you later.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay.

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No one's ordering?

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
My wife always orders carbs.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And...

215
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The one who cheats...

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Aren't you going to eat?

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm too energetic.

218
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I was so annoyed when I took the Parisian,

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but we're close.

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I guess.

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But a couple is...

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's like we're holding something in our stomachs.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I hear that it's happier to be cheated on than to be told the truth.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What do you think?

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think it's easier to be cheated on than to be told the truth.

226
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What about you?

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I want to be told the truth.

228
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I see.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Mishima is type B, and you're type AB.

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm type O.

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm type A.

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm type O too.

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Really?

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We're the same.

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's portrait time.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They're saying I am, anger left out.

237
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They have it like that.

238
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The menus gives me lots of hunger.

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Such as?

240
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Me too.

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Then let's change it to dessert.

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
For mystery testing.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Dress up?

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Excuse me.

245
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Hello?

246
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
What?

247
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,840
No, no, no. Wait a minute. What do you mean?

248
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,100
I haven't met Mr. Iwai.

249
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,980
I'm serious.

250
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,360
How can you lie about that?

251
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,860
Yui, you'll fall.

252
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
You'll fall.

253
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm sorry I even attended your welcome party.

255
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
It was fun.

256
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Yeah.

257
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
Yui.

258
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Yeah?

259
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,860
I was happy the other day.

260
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,860
You said you'd think about it.

261
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,860
Yeah.

262
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,860
You can trust me, right?

263
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Yeah.

264
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,860
No, no, no.

265
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Are you okay?

266
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Are you sick?

267
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Help me.

268
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Did you hurt your leg?

269
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,860
Are you okay?

270
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,860
You finally looked at me.

271
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,860
What?

272
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,860
I'm sorry. I'll clean up and make dinner.

273
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,860
I'm going to make beef stroganoff.

274
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
You like it, don't you?

275
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Wait.

276
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,860
You should leave it like this.

277
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,860
I'll make dinner.

278
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
I'm sorry. Thank you.

279
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
It hurts.

280
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
It's okay.

281
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,860
You can still get it back, right?

282
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,860
A request for a transfer?

283
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,860
I want to move to a place where I can spend more time.

284
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,860
But you wanted to be an editor, right?

285
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,860
That's right.

286
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:12,860
I told my boyfriend I wanted to wait until I was an editor.

287
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,860
But I'm getting busier and busier.

288
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,860
I can't keep him waiting any longer.

289
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,860
I see.

290
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,860
But that's life.

291
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,860
Is that really okay?

292
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,860
You've been working so hard.

293
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Why don't you try it until you can plan it yourself?

294
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,860
I'm afraid I'll be lazy even if I make a break.

295
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Break? It's only been three years.

296
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Lazy.

297
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,860
When I became chief, when I became deputy editor-in-chief,

298
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,860
I got greedy again.

299
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I've been doing that for a long time.

300
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:21,860
But Makoto has been alone for a long time.

301
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm sorry I'm late.

302
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Let's go.

303
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,860
I'm going.

304
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,860
No, no, no.

305
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
What's this?

306
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,860
I found it at the station on my way home.

307
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,860
It's a nice spa.

308
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,860
Well...

309
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Let's go.

310
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,860
No?

311
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,860
No, I don't think so.

312
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,860
If you take a day off on Saturday afternoon,

313
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:16,860
I'll give you a night off on Sunday.

314
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Well, if it's a day off, it's okay.

315
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Okay.

316
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Really?

317
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,860
I'll ask the owner.

318
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,860
Thank you.

319
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,860
What's wrong?

320
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,860
I haven't been traveling at all lately.

321
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,860
I'm thinking about changing my mood.

322
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Sometimes it's good to relax in a nice place, right?

323
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,860
Yeah.

324
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:08,860
I want to fill my heart with Yochan.

325
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,860
Change of mood.

326
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
Relax.

327
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,860
It looks delicious.

328
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
It's amazing.

329
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,860
I'll go to bed first.

330
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Good night.

331
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Good night.

332
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,860
I'm going to bed.

333
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,860
If I can't do it again...

334
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I'm going to bed.

335
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Are you going on a trip?

336
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
Yeah.

337
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,860
I happened to be on a cancel this week.

338
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Then, from tomorrow.

339
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Well, from noon.

340
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,860
You don't have to say anything.

341
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,860
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Thank you for your hard work.

343
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Thank you for your hard work.

344
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Thank you for your hard work.

345
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,860
I think I should stop curry.

346
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
It may break your stomach with high heart rate.

347
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,860
You're going on a trip tomorrow, right?

348
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,860
That's good.

349
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm going on a love trip with my husband.

350
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
Please.

351
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,860
I'm sorry.

352
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,860
I'm going to eat the yakisoba I made recently.

353
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Hana-chan.

354
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,860
You're angry, aren't you?

355
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
Thank you.

356
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:56,860
What?

357
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm not going to curry.

358
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Right?

359
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:15,860
I have to wish for her happiness.

360
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,860
I have to wish for it.

361
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,860
I'm Nina, from Futaba Construction.

362
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,860
I received an email.

363
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,860
I'd like to hear about the withdrawal.

364
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,860
Are you motivated?

365
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,860
It's time to decide the next editor-in-chief.

366
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,860
I thought I'd recommend it if I was serious.

367
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,860
That's right.

368
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
What's wrong?

369
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:57,860
I haven't been looking good lately.

370
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
Are you okay?

371
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,860
Yes, I'm fine.

372
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Really?

373
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:44,860
I'm sorry.

374
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:51,860
I was falling.

375
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,860
What's wrong?

376
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:06,860
I don't want to talk about it.

377
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
I was sued.

378
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:21,860
What?

379
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,860
I was the boss.

380
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,860
I knew I was in love.

381
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I didn't get along with my wife.

382
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Why did I get fooled by such a definite complaint?

383
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,860
I was so attracted to it that I could be fooled.

384
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,860
But you broke up, didn't you?

385
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Yes, three years ago.

386
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,860
I got a call from Nina.

387
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
I'm kidding.

388
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,860
I want to see her.

389
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,860
What about his wife?

390
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,860
I think she misunderstood that we were still in a relationship.

391
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Then explain it to me.

392
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
It's useless.

393
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:24,860
I'm telling the truth.

394
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:38,860
I'm the worst woman who takes other people's things.

395
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
I'll talk to the owner.

396
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Maybe he knows a lawyer.

397
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
Thank you.

398
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,860
But don't bother the store.

399
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,860
I don't think so.

400
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,860
I think she's a good woman.

401
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,860
I'm not sure if I can say that.

402
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:35,860
The bus is about to leave.

403
00:28:35,860 --> 00:29:00,860
I want to see her.

404
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,860
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:24,860
I can't live without her.

406
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:32,860
You're a good man.

407
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:04,860
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:44,860
I'm sorry.

409
00:30:44,860 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
I'm hungry.

411
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:14,860
I'm hungry.

412
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:54,860
I'm hungry.

413
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:14,860
I'm hungry.

414
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:24,860
I'm hungry.

415
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:54,860
I'm hungry.

416
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:34,860
I'm sorry.

417
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:44,860
I'm sorry.

418
00:33:44,860 --> 00:34:04,860
I'm sorry.

419
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:14,860
I'm sorry.

420
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:24,860
I'm sorry.

421
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:34,860
I'm sorry.

422
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:44,860
I'm sorry.

423
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:54,860
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I'm sorry.

425
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I'm sorry.

426
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:24,860
I'm sorry.

427
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:34,860
I'm sorry.

428
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:44,860
I'm sorry.

429
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm sorry.

430
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:04,860
I'm sorry.

431
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:14,860
I'm sorry.

432
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:24,860
I'm sorry.

433
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm sorry.

434
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:44,860
I'm sorry.

435
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:54,860
I'm sorry.

436
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:04,860
I'm sorry.

437
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:24,860
I'm sorry.

439
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:34,860
I'm sorry.

440
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:44,860
I'm sorry.

441
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:54,860
I'm sorry.

442
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:04,860
I'm sorry.

443
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm sorry.

444
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:24,860
I'm sorry.

445
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:34,860
I'm sorry.

446
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:44,860
I'm sorry.

447
00:38:44,860 --> 00:39:04,860
I'm sorry.

448
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:14,860
I'm sorry.

449
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:26,860
I once betrayed Michi.

450
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I'm sorry.

451
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:56,860
I'm sorry.

452
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:16,860

00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:46,860
I'm sorry.

00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:56,860
I'm sorry.

456
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:06,860
