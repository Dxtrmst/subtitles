1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to make a pork cutlet.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
First, I'm going to boil the pork and cut it into oil.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Vegetables rich in minerals and vitamins have the effect of reducing body fat.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Even if you're worried about your body fat, you can eat the pork.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to make a pork cutlet.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's always a little late to come home.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to make a pork cutlet.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to make a pork cutlet.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And Kaede came home late.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to sleep on the sofa so I don't wake up.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm going to work.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good morning.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Nina, you're the same as me.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Energy supplement.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm this.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's the same.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have a lot of things.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Please stop.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I have a lot of things.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a sexist.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm drunk.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm in trouble.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I know.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please forget it.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I felt like the door that no one could open had opened.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I couldn't open the door myself.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to the hospital.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If I'm forgiven, I'll be able to tell her.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's 542 yen.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Would you like to put it in your bag?

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's beautiful.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you say it, it will be true.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm finally.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I finally don't have to think about various things.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I feel like I'm drunk.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're not drinking, are you?

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Her tears.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It seemed like tears that had been accumulating in me.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not just Yoshida.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm a sexist, too.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Isn't she strong?

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ED?

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I may be.

53
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Senpai.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It took a long time to buy it with Niña.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I bought it when I was in the army.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It was in a convenience store.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to the funeral.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not good to meet the senior.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'd like to tell you as soon as possible because it's a big change in the food industry.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll look at the design.

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I may be back.

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I was avoided by Niña.

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was avoided by Niña.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Good morning.

70
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There is no coffee service.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a pity.

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll be back anytime.

73
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll be back.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is coffee free?

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm back.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Welcome back.

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I ate it first.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll eat omelet rice today.

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why?

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why did you sleep here?

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because I was late to the funeral.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Today?

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why?

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I was going to eat.

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The rice is burnt.

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Please excuse me.

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's wrong?

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's wrong?

89
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you so angry?

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you so angry?

91
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm angry because I'm not good at it.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

93
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't stand it.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're selfish.

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't live a comfortable life.

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You lied to me that you were a good leader.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You ran away.

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You don't want to be with me, do you?

99
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Did I tell you that?

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sensitive to such things.

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm angry because you're always like that.

102
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's not fair.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I have nowhere to run.

104
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're selfish.

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's not fair.

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know I'm doing something terrible.

108
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But I want you to know this.

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think of you as my family.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Even if it's a family,

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it's something I need.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We're a couple.

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're not with another family.

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Even if we're in the same family,

115
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it's completely different.

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm not leaving you.

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm happy.

119
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm very happy.

120
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But...

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But you won't hug me.

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you still up?

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Welcome back.

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm back.

125
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you want something to drink?

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No, I'm fine.

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Go to bed.

128
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Can I have a beer?

129
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you.

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tomorrow?

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No, tomorrow.

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm not done yet.

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Really?

135
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes.

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm going to work remotely.

137
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I have a meeting.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Go to bed.

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay.

140
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll leave you here.

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But I have to go to work tomorrow.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll make you some tea.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll leave you here.

144
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll go to bed in three minutes.

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But in three minutes?

148
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll call you later.

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can't answer the phone.

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Hello.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Good morning.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not enough for three minutes.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's time for the couple.

155
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The last part of the manuscript has NG.

156
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll drop the last part and do it again.

157
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll leave now.

158
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm listening.

159
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sleepy.

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm lonely.

161
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sleepy.

162
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Niini.

163
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Kitara, I'm sorry.

164
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This document has been processed.

165
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I want to confirm the correctness of the text.

166
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, this is...

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you don't understand, it's okay.

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wait a minute.

169
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This is it.

170
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The second part is different.

171
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This part is different.

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What's different?

173
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What's different?

174
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Not there, but below.

175
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Not here, but above the second part is wrong.

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not number two, but Iroha 2-2.

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's solved.

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's solved.

179
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's nice.

180
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The back is hard to see.

181
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The back is hard to see.

182
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I hope you can see the back a little more.

184
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It seems to be.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I thought the back was the main character, but the back is also the main character.

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I think it's good to be a heroine.

187
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll have a heroine.

188
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It was good to be a heroine.

189
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I think it's good.

190
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OK.

191
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry, editor.

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You can't use that way.

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm going to quit.

194
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, next year.

195
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Here you are.

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you.

197
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But why?

198
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't you think?

199
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Men can work, play, and cheat.

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If a woman wants to be successful, she will only work.

201
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
When you get married or have children, the company pretends to be kind and tries to turn you into a rich man who has time.

202
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm desperate not to get in the way.

203
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Right?

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But I don't know the desperate woman.

205
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The fear of being saved if you let your guard down.

206
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The sense of crisis that the accumulated career is taken away in an instant.

207
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Doesn't your husband look like a carefree person?

208
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Sometimes.

209
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So I thought I'd do it my way.

210
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you mean independence?

211
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Do you want to be the editor of this company?

212
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't you want to be a maid?

213
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No.

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I want to do it.

215
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry I can't come.

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's enough.

217
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Because no one will come to visit the person next to you.

218
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Don't stop.

219
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And tomorrow.

220
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Come to the end of the month once a month.

221
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll be gone for about 10 minutes.

222
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I understand, Mom.

223
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm going home.

224
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm going home now.

225
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What about your father?

226
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He came without saying anything and went home without saying anything.

227
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's alive.

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He's just like me.

229
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How are you doing?

230
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I guess so.

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Look at this.

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's it.

233
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I found it at the store downstairs.

234
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're right.

235
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Just looking at it makes me feel better.

236
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll be happy to go home.

237
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Mom, can I go to the dining room upstairs?

238
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I haven't eaten yet.

239
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's go.

240
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm told to move my body.

241
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Wait.

242
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh, well.

243
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Your father may come soon.

244
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Why don't you go see him?

245
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I have nothing to say.

246
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Really?

247
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Then go back to work.

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Before that, can you go to the store and buy it?

249
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm going to make tea.

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can't do this.

251
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't drink that kind of tea.

252
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're making tea here?

253
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Here's your wallet.

254
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't need it.

255
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I didn't tell my mother my opinion because I was afraid of my father's face.

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I thought I was sacrificing myself.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Maybe that's why I was attracted to Kaede, who was a dream job and a self-assertion.

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I thought I should support her.

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I thought so.

260
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Thank you.

261
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's a new one.

262
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm glad.

263
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I've been looking at Kaede's face for a while.

264
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Makoto.

265
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Kaede, what's up?

266
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was near the scene.

267
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I was in the right place.

268
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Here you are.

269
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What?

270
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
A cardigan.

271
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I thought it would be good for my mother.

272
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I put it on the last special.

273
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry, I have to go.

274
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Can you come with me?

275
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you.

276
00:21:45,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:15,000
